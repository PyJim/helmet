The disaster project has made significant progress over the past four weeks. We have successfully set up the project structure, implemented Flask framework, and created the necessary static and template files. The functionality to handle signup, sign-in, and report creation has been developed and tested. We have also implemented functions to retrieve specific reports and display statistics. The project is now in its final stage, and we have completed all the required tasks.
